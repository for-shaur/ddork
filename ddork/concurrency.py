"""Adaptive concurrency limiter for the competitor-enumeration fan-out.

Problem: BFS competitor enumeration grows the frontier geometrically (11 -> 121 -> 1331 at
fan-out 11), so request *volume* scales with depth even though thread count is capped at
`-w` -- a worker count that's safe at depth 1 can still get you rate-limited or IP-blocked
once hundreds of domains are queued behind it, especially with the old delay mechanism
(which only slept between *collecting* results, not between requests, so it never actually
throttled anything).

Fix: AIMD, the same idea TCP congestion control uses. Start conservative, add 1 concurrent
permit per run of clean successes, halve permits the instant a request fails (treat any
failure as a possible block/rate-limit until proven otherwise). One instance is shared for
the whole enumeration run -- not reset per BFS level -- so it keeps adapting as the frontier
grows or shrinks.
